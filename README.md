## A Git Story
A Git Story, how we use git in the real world.

### The Idea
Git is a beautiful concept and sometimes a general workflow cheatsheet is needed to reference best practises.

### The Flow
1. Cloning the Master Repository
2. From Master to Develop
3. Pulling Changes from Develop
4. Creating your own branch
5. Modifying and Editing your Files
5. Staging your files for commit
6. Commiting your files
7. Pushing your branch upstream
8. Asking for a pull request
9. Peer review
10. Merging into another branch

#### Cloning the Master Repository
```
git clone git_url
```
